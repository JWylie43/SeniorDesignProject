These are the python files that I mostly developed for my senior design project. 
"SmartLeafControl.py" is designed to be run on a RaspberryPi3 with a couple
relays, leds, LCD, and an Arduino sending serial data over the bus that contains
sensor data. 

"buttons.py" is designed to be run on the RPi3 and contains most of the same 
script that is in the SmartLeafControl.py but it also implements buttons for the 
user to control what the system does.
